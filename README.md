*DESCRIPTION*: INTERACTIVE QUIZ APPLICATION
This project is a fully functional Interactive Quiz Application developed using core web technologies. It is designed to test user knowledge with multiple-choice questions while providing real-time feedback and tracking performance throughout the quiz. The application is visually polished, responsive, and runs entirely within the browser without needing any backend server or database.

>Objective and Overview:
The main goal of the project was to build a lightweight quiz app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where users can:

Answer a set of 10 dynamic, pre-defined questions.

Receive instant feedback for each response (correct or incorrect).

View their score update as they progress.

Get a final results screen upon quiz completion.

The questions are loaded dynamically through JavaScript, and only one question is displayed at a time, creating a clean and focused user experience.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
HTML5 ‚Äì Used to build the core structure and layout of the quiz interface, such as buttons, containers, and text sections.

CSS3 ‚Äì Applied for styling the entire application. Custom styles were written to create a clean, modern, and mobile-responsive design.

JavaScript (Vanilla) ‚Äì Handles all quiz logic, such as loading questions, checking answers, displaying feedback, updating scores, and managing quiz flow.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) ‚Äì The primary code editor used to write and test the code. It supports syntax highlighting, live previews, and Git integration, making development smooth and efficient.

Git & GitHub ‚Äì Used for version control and source code management. All changes were tracked, committed, and pushed to a GitHub repository.

GitHub Pages ‚Äì The app was deployed using GitHub Pages to make it publicly accessible online. This platform is ideal for hosting static sites built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

üåê How to Use the Application
Open the app by visiting the GitHub Pages deployment link.

The first question will appear along with four answer options.

Click an answer to receive instant feedback.

After feedback is shown, click the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button to continue.

Once all 10 questions are completed, the app displays the final score along with a message.

Users can refresh the page to restart the quiz.

This intuitive flow makes the app usable by all age groups without needing prior instructions.

üéØ Real-World Applications
This quiz application has many potential use cases in real-world scenarios, including:

E-learning platforms: For testing users after lessons or modules.

School and college projects: As a front-end development mini-project.

Corporate training: Quick knowledge checks or product knowledge assessments.

Job readiness tests: A base for skill-testing modules during recruitment.

Surveys and polls: With minor modification, it can be adapted into survey forms.

Its frontend-only architecture makes it lightweight, fast, and easy to host anywhere.

üì¶ File Structure
The application is organized into three core files:

index.html ‚Äì The main HTML file for structure.

style.css ‚Äì Contains all design and layout rules.

script.js ‚Äì Includes all quiz logic, feedback, and scoring functionality.

These files were uploaded to GitHub using both the "Upload files" method and Git via Terminal, depending on the workflow. Developers can also use GitHub Desktop or Visual Studio Code‚Äôs terminal to push code 
directly to the remote repository

üìÑ Conclusion
This project showcases strong fundamentals in front-end development, including DOM manipulation, responsive design, and logic implementation using JavaScript. It also demonstrates the use of modern developer tools like VS Code, Git, and GitHub Pages. The result is a lightweight, interactive quiz application that can be deployed anywhere and extended for multiple use cases with minimal adjustments.
